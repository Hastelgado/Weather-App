# Weather Project
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/ydJCdN_DmCo>

## Description:
The project's main feature/goal is to use an Autocomplete search bar to go over 42,000+ city locations by searching the city name or country and then, call an API to display its weather forecast.

## What I learned:
* Understanding how to manipulate the DOM in Javascript.
* Building a single dynamic responsive page in Javascript.
* Using CSV files as the database in Python.
* Building an **Auto-complete** search function.
* Using API's.
* Understanding CSS's Flexbox.
* Using Flask's Jinja HTML templating language.

## Obtaining your own API key.
Visit <https://openweathermap.org/api> for instructions.

# Configuring a Virtual Environment for the needed packages
1. Run "python -m venv venv", and click "yes" if prompted by your editor if you wish to use this Venv for the current workspace folder.
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the necessary packages.

# Running the app
To run the app, simply start Flaskâ€™s built-in web server (within your work folder):
"flask run"
### Note: In the app.py file, you might need to replace my old API URL with your new one, while keeping the variable's location as it is.
